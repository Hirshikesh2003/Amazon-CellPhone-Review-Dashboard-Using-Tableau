# Brand VS Price

The above visualization gives us the context of change in the price of the Brand across the years. As it is plotted with date and price. We have two filters one for the range of dates and the other one to select brands. So a user can select the brand he wants to visualize the price and still use the slider to know the price during that particular range.
